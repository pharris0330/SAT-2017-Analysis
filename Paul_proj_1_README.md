### Brief summary of analysis

A large part of my outside research revolved around the [US Census Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) and the [2019 US Cities Sustainable Development Report](https://www.sustainabledevelopment.report/reports/2019-us-cities-sustainable-development-report/). 
    
Census bureau website includes census data on homeownership, degrees obtained, income and more. The Census is mandated by constitution. The data collected by the census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives (a process called apportionment) and is also used to adjust or redraw electoral districts based on where populations have increased or decreased.
    
The UN developed sustainable development goals (SDG) as a means to achieve a base level of sustainability for all countries on planet Earth.
